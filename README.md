![OSS Lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/osslifecycle?file_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fotto-de%2Fsecurity-event-schema%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2FOSSMETADATA)

This is the generic format for security events generated by sources from Iris - our internal event distribution system. 
This repository shall:
1. Help our teams to reference the schema for schema validation from a public endpoint
2. Give you as a reader insights and demonstrate how we standardize the vast amount of different alarming sources (AWS Sercices, GitHub, ...) and make these consumable in a generic manner
