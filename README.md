# Eventformat
This is the generic format for security events generated by sources from Iris - our internal event distribution system. 
This repository shall:
1. Help our teams to reference the schema for schema validation from a public endpoint
2. Give you as a reader insights and demonstrate how we standardize the vast amount of different alarming sources (AWS Sercices, GitHub, ...) and make these consumable in a generic manner
